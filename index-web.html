      <div class="first">My name is Sergey. I am a university student. Every day I have three or four classes, so I do not usually have much time for meals. Cooking is not my hobby, I usually eat what my mother cooks for me or go to the student canteen. In the morning we gather together in our kitchen at 7 o'clock and have our breakfast. It is a family tradition. My mother lays the table. There are different kinds of sandwiches, sausages, bacon with eggs and jam. I often drink a cup of tea or coffee and eat a sandwich with butter and cheese.

After supper I do my home work, play computer games and watch TV. Before going to bed I sometimes eat some fruit or drink fruit juice.
